# CitiBike Trip Data -Q1 2019 v. Q2 2020

## Visual 1: Bar Graph – 2019 v. 2020 Total number of trips
* There was an increase in total trips for Q1 of 2020 from Q1 of 2019. 

## Visual 2: Start Station – Total Number of Rides started at each location per year. 
The top 10 places to start a trip are:
1. Pershing Square North
2. W21st & 6 Ave
3. 8 Ave & W 31st
4. E 17 St & Broadway
5. Broadway & E 22St.
6. Broadway & E 14 St.
7. 8 Ave. & W 33St
8. W 41st & Ave
9. 6 Ave. & W 33 St.
10. E 47 St. & Park Ave.
* This makes sense because most of the stations are centered around heavily trafficked areas and near subway stops that lead into the city. 
* Conversely, the least popular start destinations are in Brooklyn. This stations are in communities where is does not appear to be a need for immediate quick travel. 

## Visual 3: End Station – Total Number of Rides ended at each location per year. 
* The Top 10 places to end a trip are:
1. Pershing Square North
2. Broadway & E 22St.
3. 8 Ave & W 31st
4. W21st & 6 Ave
5. E 17 St & Broadway
6. Broadway & E 14 St.
7. 8 Ave. & W 33St
8. W 41st & Ave
9. E 47 St. & Park Ave.
10. Lafayette St. &  E 8 St.
This makes sense because most of the stations are centered around heavily trafficked areas and near subway stops that lead into the city. 


## Visual 4: Line Graph – Total Number of Trips per Hour
* For 2019 and 2020, the most popular hours to start a trip are the same and is in line with what we would expect, in the morning and the evening hours before and after work. 8 am and 5pm.

## Visual 5: Line Graph – Total number of rides per age (2019 v. 2020)
* An interesting point in the data is the birth year 1969 (age 51) has a high spike in starting rides. I believe this is an anomaly and probably has to due with the way the citi data is retrieved. If a user starts a ride and does not change their age, I would presume that the default is 1969. 
* In both years people born in the year 1990 (age 29-30) are the most frequent riders. I think this in line with what we would expect of people in this age group. They most likely individuals who use the bikes to commute to work or, for vacationers, as a form of transportation to view the city.
